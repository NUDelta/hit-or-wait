# hit-or-wait

To install  required packages
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

I use venv, but it is not necessary.

Run working test of hit-or-wait in NU campus, for p2p setting, and for social benefit:
```python -m tests.mdp.simple.run```

See plot of computational geometry techniques to find Voronoi diagram:
```
cd mdp/setup
python run.py
```

Run simulation I used for Open House. A proof-of-concept of hit-or-wait for social benefit:
```python simulations/openhouse_sim.py```

Run simulation HQ/YK made, showing value of hit-or-wait compared to other algos
```python simulations/gridSim.py```
